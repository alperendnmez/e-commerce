# Order Management System - Final Review

## Improvements Made

1. **Schema & Type Consistency**
   - Made orderNumber a required field in schema
   - Ensured consistent OrderItem type definitions
   - Updated formatOrderItems function to include all required fields

2. **Error Handling**
   - Standardized toast notifications using shadcn/UI toast
   - Implemented consistent ApiError usage in API endpoints
   - Added withErrorHandler middleware to all order endpoints

3. **Status Transition Validation**
   - Ensured consistent VALID_STATUS_TRANSITIONS usage
   - Added proper error messaging for invalid transitions

4. **Frontend-Backend Communication**
   - Fixed client-side validation to match server-side rules
   - Updated OrderStatusUtils to match backend logic
   - Standardized error handling across components

5. **Type Safety**
   - Improved type references and interfaces
   - Added specific OrderErrorType usage for clearer error reporting

## Testing Needed

- Verify database migrations for required orderNumber
- Test order creation, retrieval, and status transitions
- Verify error handling in edge cases (e.g., invalid transitions)

The order management system now has consistent types, proper error handling, and standardized validation logic across both front and backend components.
