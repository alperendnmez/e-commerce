## Overview

The order management system is a critical component of our e-commerce platform that handles all aspects of order processing, from creation to fulfillment. It supports various functions including:

- Creating new orders
- Processing payments
- Managing order statuses
- Handling order cancellations and refunds
- Tracking inventory changes
- Generating order timelines
- Applying discounts and coupons

## Architecture

The order management system follows a layered architecture:

1. **API Layer** - Handles HTTP requests and responses
2. **Service Layer** - Contains business logic and data access
3. **Data Access Layer** - Interacts with the database using Prisma ORM
4. **Types and Helpers** - Provides type definitions and utility functions

```

│ (Endpoints) │◀──────│  (Business  │◀──────│  (Database) │

                      └─────────────┘
```

## Service Layer

The service layer isolates the business logic from the API endpoints, providing better separation of concerns and testability. The `OrderService` class in `services/orderService.ts` provides the following methods:

- `getOrders()` - Retrieves a paginated list of orders with filtering options
- `getOrderById()` - Retrieves a single order by ID with authorization check
- `createOrder()` - Creates a new order and handles stock management
- `updateOrderStatus()` - Updates an order's status and manages timeline entries
- `updateOrderNotes()` - Updates admin notes for an order
- `deleteOrder()` - Deletes an order and restores product stock

## API Endpoints

The order management system exposes several REST endpoints:

### Admin Endpoints

- `GET /api/orders` - List all orders with filtering and pagination
- `POST /api/orders` - Create a new order
- `GET /api/orders/:id` - Get order details
- `PUT /api/orders/:id` - Update order status or admin notes
- `DELETE /api/orders/:id` - Delete an order

### Customer Endpoints

- `GET /api/user/orders` - List a user's orders
- `GET /api/user/orders/:id` - Get details of a user's order
- `POST /api/user/orders/:id` - Cancel a user's order

## Error Handling

The system uses a centralized error handling approach via the `withErrorHandler` middleware. This provides consistent error responses across all endpoints.

### Error Types

- `VALIDATION` - Invalid input data (400)
- `NOT_FOUND` - Resource not found (404)
- `UNAUTHORIZED` - Authentication required (401)
- `FORBIDDEN` - Insufficient permissions (403)
- `CONFLICT` - Operation conflicts with current state (409)
- `INTERNAL` - Server error (500)

### Error Response Format

```json
{
  "error": "Clear error message",
  "type": "ERROR_TYPE",
  "details": {
    // Additional context if available
  }
}
```

## Testing

The order management system includes unit tests for the service layer, focusing on testing business logic in isolation from the API and database layers. Tests use Vitest and mock the Prisma client to avoid actual database interactions.

Test coverage includes:
- Order retrieval (with and without user authorization)
- Order status updates
- Order creation validation
- Error handling scenarios

## Types and Interfaces

The system uses TypeScript to ensure type safety throughout the codebase. Key types include:

- `FormattedOrder` - Represents an order formatted for API responses
- `OrderWithRelations` - Represents an order with all its relations from Prisma
- `OrderStatus` - Enum representing possible order statuses

## Recent Improvements

Recent improvements to the order management system include:

1. **Service Layer Implementation**
   - Added a service layer to separate business logic from API endpoints
   - Improved testability by isolating database operations

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Implemented consistent error responses across all endpoints
   - Added specific error types and mappers for Prisma errors

3. **Type Safety Improvements**
   - Added stronger typing for API endpoints and services
   - Replaced `any` types with proper interfaces

4. **Unit Testing**
   - Added unit tests for the service layer
   - Set up proper mocking for the Prisma client

5. **API Standardization**
   - Updated all endpoints to follow RESTful principles
   - Made response formats consistent across all endpoints

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements to the order management system:

1. **Schema Validation**
   - Add a schema validation library (e.g., Zod) for request validation

2. **Advanced Search and Filtering**
   - Implement more sophisticated filtering options for orders
   - Add full-text search capabilities

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize database queries for large order volumes
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data

4. **Reporting Features**
   - Add endpoints for generating order reports and analytics
   - Implement export functionality for order data

5. **Webhooks**
   - Add webhook support for order status changes
   - Allow integration with external systems
