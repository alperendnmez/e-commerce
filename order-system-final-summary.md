   - Created and applied a migration to set NOT NULL constraint
   - Ensured consistent orderNumber generation in createOrder function

2. **Type Consistency**
   - Standardized OrderItem interface across frontend and backend
   - Added missing fields like productSlug and total
   - Ensured proper inclusion of variant details

3. **Error Handling**
   - Standardized toast notifications using shadcn UI
   - Implemented consistent ApiError usage in all API endpoints
   - Added withErrorHandler middleware to all order-related endpoints

4. **Status Transition Logic**

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Order Creation**
   - Verify that orders are properly created with required orderNumber
   - Ensure orderNumber is unique across all orders

2. **Test Status Transitions**
   - Verify that valid transitions work correctly
   - Confirm invalid transitions are properly blocked
   - Test edge cases like cancellations and refunds

3. **Test Error Handling**
   - Confirm proper error messages for invalid operations

The order management system is now more robust, with consistent validation, proper error handling, and standardized interfaces. These improvements ensure the application can reliably handle orders in a production environment.
